# job-app-tracker

I am currently using a spread sheet and I am getting tired of scrolling through it,
its also hard to read.

This app is intended to store application data, show data to a table and allow for updates.

I will also add some simple analysis like roi, what avenues have returned interviews,
etc. Still thinking about what I want to do here

Data will be stored to MongoDb ran locally, this is yet to be implemented.

Built with webpack and express, written in es6
To run the app locally npm start, runs on local host 8080
